Dear [Name];

We have started issuing block addresses to all users on the system. 

What is this?
In order to reward teachers who were brave enough to join on this journey early on, we have set up a reward system. We feel that it is important to recognize the contribution you are making to the development of education. Your I.B.A will allow us to give reward you with additional points as we reach milestones along the way. All your "Founders Rewards" will be transfered to this address.

What do you I need to do?
There are a few things that you need to do at this point. After these steps, you will be all set.

1. Print out this email or transfer it out of your email inbox and save it to your computer.
2. Delete this email. 
3. Keep your copy safe. There are no copies of this block address.
4. Login to your account and check that this address [address] is listed on your profile page.

What if I lose this?
You can request a new I.B.A at any point in time. Future rewards will be credited to that new address. We recommend doing this periodically even if you have not lost your address. If you do lose an address, there is no way to recover the rewards that have been transferred to that address.

Thanks as always for your support and we are keen to share our success with you!

Uwaaa!
