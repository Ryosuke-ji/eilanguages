Mhoro!


Now that you have schools and classes added, you can go ahead and get stuck into creating your schedule.

What is this schedule of which we speak?
Eigomonster allows you to keep track of what you are teaching to whom, when and where. The simple drag and drop interface will allow you to create a digital schedule for a full month in a matters of minutes.

What does it do?
The schedule is where you will spend most of your time. It has many functions to help you keep on top of your teaching such as:
when am I teaching?
what lesson plan will I use?
which activities will I use?
which materials do I need?
Of course once this data is in, it will help you understand:
what DID I teach?
what plan DID I use?
how DID this class go?
what do I need to remember for next time?
This information will also automatically be assigned to the relevant school and class so you can view this information in relation to them as well.

What is the benefit of creating a schedule?
Over and above what we mentioned above, keeping a schedule will:
allow you to stay organised
plan in context to a given class
plan collaboratively with your colleagues
automatically receive lesson plan, activity and material suggestions in advanceÂ 
How do I create these ostentatious oodles of orderly omnipotent oblectation?
