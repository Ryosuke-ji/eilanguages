Jambo!

Moving on, today we are going to tackle classes. These are the easiest to add but are the most essential when it comes to managing your schedule. Classes give you in-depth insights about your students.

What are "Classes"?
They are the people who you teach. They are a basic grouping that allows you to understand to whom you have taught what to and when. It could be one person or forty people.

Why do I need to add them?
Your schedule relies on you having classes added to your profile. You cannot use your schedule if you do not have classes added and you will not be able to get suggested plans and activities delivered to you.

What is the benefit?
As you add classes to your schedule, you will begin to gain insight into how each class has progressed. Part of this will be to let you know:
What objectives you are hitting
The topics being learnt
Teaching styles you areÂ employing
The progress each class is making
A detailed teaching diary for each class
