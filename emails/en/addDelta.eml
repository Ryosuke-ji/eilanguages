Yebo!

Are you ready for hands-free teaching? Do you long to be able to walk into the staffroom and have a set of fresh new materials 
ready to print? Do you want to be able to leave when the kids do? Yes?! We got got your back!

What are "Deltas"?
"Deltas" are a new feature that allow you to tell eigomonster how your kids are doing so that the application can automatically modify 
the materials based on the students learning needs. 

Why do I need them?
Deltas are able to respond to your students' development in realtime and then create materials appropriate to their level of ability. You will only need 5 minutes a week to update the deltas
and they'll do the hours of work needed to create materials in a matter of seconds.

No way!
Yes way! They are really easy to set up too. Deltas are the first step to individualized teaching materials. They are currently 
in Beta mode (not really ready for showtime but mostly there) and will definitely help you bring the magic to your class very quickly.

Point me to these dynamic delicacies of delightful delta goodness!
