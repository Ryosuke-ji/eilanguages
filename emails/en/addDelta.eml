Yebo!

Are you ready for hands free teaching? Do you long to be able to walk into the staffroom and have a pile of fresh new materials 
ready to print? Do you want to be able to leave when the kids do? Yes?! We got got your back!

What are they?
Deltas are a new feature that allow you tell eigomonster how your kids are doing so that the application can automatically modify 
the materials based on the students learning needs. 

Why do I need them?
Deltas are able to to respond to your students in realtime and then create materials appropriate to their level of ability. They need 5 minutes a week from you
and they'll do the hours of work needed to achieve in a matter of seconds.

No way!
Yes way! They are really easy to set up too. Deltas are the first step to fully individualised teaching materials. They are currently 
in Beta mode (not really ready for show time but mostly there) but will defintely help you bring the magic to your class very quickly.

Point me to these dynamic delicacies of delightful delta goodness!
