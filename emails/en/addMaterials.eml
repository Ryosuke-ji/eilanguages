こんにちは!

Today we are going to be talking about materials. These are the things that you use to bring your lessons to life. They can be literally anything from a piece of chalk right through to a life size death star complete with poorly conceived exhaust port!

Why do I need to add these?
Materials are the bedrock of your lessons and eigomonster will help you keep track of what you use to teach. Reminding you at the right time of all the awesome tools you have at your disposal.

What can I add?
The materials database is really just a catalogue so you can add pretty much anything you like. This is just a way for you to keep track of what you need to teach a successful lesson. You can, of course, upload PDF's, Images. links to videos and other such materials. Currently we are NOT allowing word and excel documents because while we all like sharing... no one likes viruses.

What is the benefit?
Keeping your materials all in in one place helps you:

easily remember what you have 
get reminders during lesson planning about things you can add
never lose your documents again
easily share materials with teaching colleagues
keep track of how many times your are using materials to keep content fresh
