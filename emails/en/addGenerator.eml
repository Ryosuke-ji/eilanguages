Hei ta!


Technology is great and we have some that will allow you to up your teaching game. Generators!

What are they?
These allow you to very quickly create material sets that you can use in class. Currently you can create bingo sheets and work practice sheets
but we will be adding to these in the future.

Why do I need them?
Creating good materials takes time. Generators take the hassle out of this process and allow you to, for example, create a unique bingo sheet
for each of your students, complete with pictures and addtional features in under 10 minutes

Say what?!
Yes! Generators are awesome. They can allow you to acheive multiple teaching objectives in one material set. Currently the generators are focused 
on reading and writing and the bingo generator can help:

automatically associate pictures with words
present words in challenging ways (remove vowel, remove consonants etc.)
help students learn how to write (show the writing order)
