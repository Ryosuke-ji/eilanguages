Hei ta!


Technology is great and we have some that will allow you to up your teaching game. Generators!

What are "Generators"?
These allow you to very quickly create material sets that you can use in class. Currently, you can create bingo and word practice sheets
but we will be adding to these in the future.

Why do I need them?
Creating good materials takes time. Generators take the hassle out of this process and allow you to, for example, create a unique bingo sheet
for each of your students, complete with pictures and addtional features in under 10 minutes.

Say what?!
Yes! Generators are awesome. They can also allow you to acheive multiple teaching objectives in one material set. Currently, the generators are focused 
on reading and writing. The bingo generator can help:
Introduce students to new vocabulary and concepts
Automatically associate pictures with words
Present words in challenging ways (remove vowels, remove consonants, etc.)
Help students learn how to write (show the writing order)
How do I get these super smooth, viscously velvety caramel cremes?!
