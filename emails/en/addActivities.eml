Bonjour!

We are moving on to the most interesting part of eigomonster and that is your activities. These are the things that do all the heavy lifting in your lesson moving your little monsters from "I don't know" to "I got this."

What are "Activities"?
These are the ways in which your students use materials to show that they have understood the lesson contents on their own.

Why do I need them?
As teachers we often get used to doing things in a certain way. The way that the activities are laid out on eigomonster helps you think about them from the point of view of someone who has no idea what your favorite activity is. They are broken down logically into chunks and you can even add a step-by-step "What do I need to do to run this activity successfully" guide. This will help you plan for success by covering all circumstances.

What are the benefits?
Adding activities to your profile moves you one step closer to unleashing the full awesomeness of eigomonster.
