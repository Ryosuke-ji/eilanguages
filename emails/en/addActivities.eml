Bonjour!

We are moving on to the most interesting part of eigomonster and that is your activities. These are the things that do all the heavy lifting in your lesson moving your little monsters from "I don't know." to "Maybe you should stop talking now?".

What are activities?
These are really the ways in which your students use materials to be able to produce, on their own, whatever content it is you are teaching.

Why do I need them?
As teachers we often get used to doing things in a certain way. The way that the activities are laid out on eigomonster helps you think about them from the point of view of someone who has no idea what your favourite activity is. They broken down logically into chunks and you can even add a step by step "what do I need to do to run this activity successfully" guide. This will help you plan for success by covering all eventualities
