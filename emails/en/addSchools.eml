Salut!


Today we are going to be focusing on schools. These are the places where you teach. For most teachers, this will just be one school unless you are a substitute teacher who travels around. 

What are "Schools"?
They can be anywhere including your own home if you are homeschooling. Think of them as a folder in which you can add classes. 

Why do I need to add them?
If you want to use the schedule, you will need to have schools.

What is the benefit?
Adding schools will allow you to:
Keep a teaching diary
Use the schedule to stay organized
Organize your classes
Understand the teaching resources you have access to and which lesson plans will work best for your situation
How do I add these gravy-soaked goodies?!

Video Tutorial
Please watch the video tutorial to see an actual school being added. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video must be worth about 1,440,000 words a minute! 

Thanks and stay awesome!
