Zdravo!


You made it! We are now adding the pop stars of teaching to your profile: Lesson Plans. 

What are "Lesson Plans"?
Lesson plans are simply a collection of activities that have been grouped together to achieve a specific teaching outcome. 

Why do I need them?
Walking into a class with no lesson plan is like grocery shopping on an empty stomach. You leave with basket full of stuff that you don't need and have to go back the next day to buy the stuff you <em>actually</em> went in there to get. 

I can plan quicker on paper!
This is 100% true and, oddly enough, 100% false. eigomonster is a comprehensive educational tool. The creation of a lesson plan is only about 5% of the value. By adding a lesson plan to eigomonster, we are able to help you answer in seconds some really important questions that pencil and paper simply cannot:
What have I taught to my students this month?
How have these classes gone?
What have they learnt?
What could I add to help them learn more?
Which curriculm objectives have I achieved?
Which materials are the most effective?
Which lesson(s) was the most effective?
What should I teach them next?
How should I teach it to them?
Am I overusing activities and materials?
Ok! Ok! I get it! How do I add these sugar coated, nougat centred, super succulent, splendiferous sprinkles to my profile?!
